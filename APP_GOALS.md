## Goal Alignment Principles

### For All Development Activities:
1. **Always align with defined end goals** - Every feature, fix, or change must contribute to one or more end goals
2. **Prioritize systematically** - Address goals in order unless business needs dictate otherwise
3. **Measure progress** - Track completion against success criteria
4. **Maintain quality** - Never compromise quality to achieve speed
5. **Document decisions** - Record why choices were made in context of end goals

### For Agents and Subagents:
1. **Validate alignment** - Before starting any task, confirm it aligns with end goals
2. **Report deviations** - Flag any conflicts with end goals immediately
3. **Suggest improvements** - Propose changes to end goals when appropriate
4. **Maintain consistency** - Ensure all work follows established patterns and standards
5. **Document contributions** - Clearly describe how work advances end goals

---

## Modification Process

This document should be treated as a living artifact. To propose changes:

1. **Identify the need** - Clearly articulate why a change is necessary
2. **Assess impact** - Evaluate how the change affects other goals and existing work
3. **Propose solution** - Document the suggested modification with rationale
4. **Review and approve** - Obtain appropriate stakeholder approval
5. **Update and communicate** - Modify document and notify all team members

---

## Review Schedule

This document should be reviewed:
- **Weekly** during active development
- **Monthly** during maintenance phases
- **Immediately** when major project changes occur
- **Before** starting new major features or initiatives
